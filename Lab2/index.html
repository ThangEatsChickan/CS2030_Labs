<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>
  The Kent Ridge Cruise Centre just opened and
  you are required to design a program to decide how many loaders 
  to buy based on a single-day cruise schedule.
</p>

<h4>Loaders</h4>
<p>
  Loaders are used to serve cruises. From the time a cruise arrives, as many loaders as required will
  serve this cruise. They will then continue to serve the cruise until the service has been completed
  after a certain number of minutes.
</p>
<p>
  While the loaders are in the midst of serving a cruise, they cannot serve another cruise up until
  the current service has been completed.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if an incoming cruise arrives at 12PM, requires two loaders, and 60 min for it to be
  fully served, then,
  <ul>
    <li>
      At 12PM, there must be two vacant loaders.
    </li>
    <li>
      These two loaders will serve the cruise from 12PM - 1PM.
    </li>
    <li>
      They can only serve another cruise from 1PM onwards.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<!--
<p>
  Furthermore, as the Cruise Centre wants to go green, their policy states that
  every third loader purchased must be a loader made from recycled materials 
  (referred to as a RecycledLoader), which undergoes maintenance for
  one hour after each service. The recycled loader is unable to serve a cruise 
  during the maintenance period.
</p>
-->

<h4>Cruises</h4>
<p>
  All cruises have two attributes: a unique identifier, and a time of arrival.
</p>

<p>
  The unique identifier is a String, for example, <tt>A1234</tt>. The time of arrival comes in HHMM format, such as 2359,
  denoting that the cruise has arrived at 11:59PM on that day.
  
</p>
<p>
  There can be up to 30 cruises that arrive in a day. Every cruise <b>must be served by loaders immediately upon arrival</b>.
  There are two types of cruises:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cruise:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes a fixed 30min for a loader to fully load.</li>
      <li>Requires only one loader for it to be fully served.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A schedule entry is read as such:
      <pre>A1234 0000</pre> denoting that cruise A1234 arrives at 12AM, requires 1 loader and 30 minutes
      to be fully served.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>BigCruise:
    <p>
      BigCruises have an identifier that starts with the character 'B' (case-sensitive).
      Furthermore, they have a variable number of loaders and time required to serve it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes T minutes to serve, where T is between 0 to 99.</li>
      <li>Requires X loaders to fully load, where X is between 0 to 9.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A schedule entry is read as such:
      <pre>B1234 0000 5 75</pre> denoting that cruise B1234 arrives at 12AM, requires 5 loaders and 75
      minutes to be fully served.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  The program determines the number of loaders and the allocation schedule by the 
  following steps (sub-optimal):
  <ul>
    <li>
      For each cruise, check through the inventory of loaders, starting from the loader 
      first purchased and so on.
    </li>
    <li>The first (or first few) loaders available will be used to serve the cruise.</li>
    <li>
      If there are not enough loaders, purchase a new one(s), and that loader(s) will 
      be used to serve the cruise.</li>
<!--      
    <li>Every third loader purchased must be a recycled loader.</li>
-->    
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>
  Write a program that reads in the number of cruises in the schedule as an integer, and a list of cruises 
  that will arrive for that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The program will output the loader allocation schedule.
</p>


<p>
  Take note of the following assumptions:
  <ul>
    <li>Input cruises are presented chronologically by arrival time.</li>
	  <li>There can be up to 30 cruises in one day.</li>
	  <li>There are no duplicates in the input cruises.</li>
    <li>All cruises will arrive and be completely served within a single day.</li>
    <li>Input validation is not required and all inputs can be assumed to be correct.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Although this problem can be implemented procedurally, you should learn to model your solution
  using an object-oriented approach instead.
</p>

<p>This task is divided into five levels. You need to complete <strong>ALL</strong> levels.</p>

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=10>

<!-- Level 1 -->
<tr><td><h4>Level 1</h4>

<p>
  <big><strong>Represent a Cruise</strong></big>
</p>

<p>
Design an <b>immutable</b> class <tt>Cruise</tt> that represents a Cruise instance, with a unique identifier string, and the time of arrival as an integer.
</p>
<p> 
Note that the time of arrival is input in HHMM format. Hence, <tt>0</tt> or <tt>0000</tt> refers to 00:00 (12AM),
<tt>30</tt> or <tt>0030</tt> refers to 00:30 (12:30AM), and <tt>130</tt> or <tt>0130</tt> refers to 01:30 (1:30AM).
</p>

<p>
  You are also required to implement a <tt>getServiceCompletionTime</tt> method, which returns the time in minutes
  of when the service will be completed.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if the Cruise arrives at 12PM, the service completion time is 12:30PM, which is 750 minutes from 00:00.
  (12 * 60) + 30 = 750)
</p>

<p>
The String representation of cruises are:<pre>cruiseID@HHMM</pre>The <tt>%0Xd</tt> format specifier might be of use to you,
where the integer will be represented by an X-digit zero-padded number.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, <pre>String.format("%04d", 20)</pre> would return <tt>0020</tt>.
</p>
